# Get a play data set:
PlayData <- read_tsv("data/PlayData.txt")
# PlayData
# Let's see the scenarios we discussed in class:
# Scenario 1: Transformation height & width
PlayData$height/PlayData$width

# For the other scenarios, tidy data would be a 
# better starting point:
# we'll use gather()
# 4 arguments
# 1 - data
# 2,3 - key,value pair - i.e. name for OUTPUT
# 4 - the ID or the MEASURE variables

# using ID variables ("exclude" using -)
# gather(PlayData, "key", "value", -c("type", "time"))

# using MEASURE variables (INCLUDE by naming columns)
PlayData_t <- pivot_longer(PlayData, names_to = "key", values_to = "value", c("height", "width"))

# using ID variables (EXCLUDE columns using the - notation)
PlayData_t <- pivot_longer(PlayData, names_to = "key", values_to = "value", -c("type", "time"))


# Scenario 2: Transformation across time 1 & 2
# difference from time 1 to time 2 for each type and key
# we only want one value as output (pseudo "aggregation" function)
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(type, key) %>% 
  summarise(time_diff = value[time == 2] - value[time == 1])

  # group_split()
  
# standardize to time 1
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(type, key) %>% 
  mutate(time_std = value/value[time == 1])

# Scenario 3: Transformation across type A & B
# A/B for each time and key
# ??? i.e. 
# for height at time 1: 10/30
# for height at time 2: 20/40
# for width at time 1: 50/70
# for width at time 2: 60/80
# As aggregration
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(time, key) %>% 
  summarise(type_diff = value[type == "A"]/value[type == "B"])

# As transformation
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(time, key) %>% 
  mutate(type_diff = value[type == "A"]/value[type == "B"])

# e.g. what is "A" is the background,
# standardize against background for each key and time:
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(time, key) %>% 
  summarise(bkg_std =  value/value[type == "A"] )
  
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(time, key) %>% 
  mutate(bkg_std =  value/value[type == "A"] )
